# E-commerce Customer Yearly Spending Analysis
This project is a case study that analyzes customer data from an e-commerce company to identify patterns and correlations between customer characteristics and their yearly spending. The data is preprocessed, explored, and visualized to understand the relationships between different features. A linear regression model is then built and trained to predict the yearly spending of customers based on their characteristics.
